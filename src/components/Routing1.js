      <h1>ROUTING</h1>
      <p>In ReactJS, routing is the process of determining which components to display based on the current URL or application state. This is commonly used in single-page applications (SPAs) where the entire UI is built using React components and navigation happens without full page reloads.</p>
      <p>One popular library for routing in ReactJS is React Router. React Router provides a declarative way to define routes in your application and map them to corresponding React components.</p>
